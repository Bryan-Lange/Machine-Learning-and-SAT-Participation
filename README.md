### 1  Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

## Problem Statement
In this project we are given ACT and SAT exam statistics from 2017 and 2018 and our task is to advise the College Board (administer of the SAT exam) of our recommendations on how to increase participation levels. Initiatives taken by the Board in recent years and cost reductive measures have led to tremendous growth and my recommendation is to continue to expand test taking options which help to promote the ubiquity of the SAT and continue to strenghten the our bond with local and State school systems.
